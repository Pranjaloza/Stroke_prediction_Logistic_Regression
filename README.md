# Stroke_prediction_Logistic_Regression
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person is at risk of stroke based on health and demographic features. 

## Task overview
- Loaded and cleaned the stroke prediction dataset
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables
- Scaled numerical features for better model performance
- Trained a Logistic Regression model with class balancing
- Evaluated model using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC
- Tuned prediction threshold to reduce false positives

## Dataset
- Stroke prediction dataset(healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv)
